            <h3>Why I do what I do</h3>
            <p class="info infoinfo">I have an immense passion for art and design and using that passion to help people with their businesses, hobbies, and brands. I specialize in print design, re-branding, and photography.I always put the needs of my clients first then add a little bit of my clean cut but edgy style into it as well.</p>
            <p class="info infoinfo">PRINT DESIGN: Posters, album covers, books, labels, cards, you name it and I can do it and I can do it well.</p>
            <p class="info infoinfo">RE-BRANDING: I can change your look to suit your needs and create something unique and most importantly, something you will be proud to show off!</p>
            <p class="info infoinfo">PHOTOGRAPHY: To add to websites, posters, albums, of your band, shops, and more. I enjoy dark and moody photography as much as I love sunny and bright photography. Contrast is what I do best. I even love the challenge of getting both into one photograph. Whatever you like I can make it happen. I use Polaroids, and my lovely Nikon D90.</p>
